# my source code

I'm a OIer, and I practice almost everyday. One day one of my friends met a problem that each program he coded couldn't be extracted. This reminds me that recording my programs is necessary.I will move programs to this repository continously and this repository isn't completed yet.The repository will include several thousands charactors when it is completed. Most of the problems are found on <www.luogu.com.cn>

我用这个仓库来存储自己平时训练所做的题,以防丢失,毕竟自己几千k的代码也是笔财富(.

代码还没搬全.

以 [洛谷](www.luogu.com.cn) 的题为主。
